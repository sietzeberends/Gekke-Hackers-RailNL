## Experiment 3 - disable Utrecht:
Utrecht is a very important station in The Netherlands and has a lot of critical connections around it. To measure the importance of this station we ran the maps of Holland with both Utrecht and without Utrecht to see the difference.

### Results:
When Utrecht is removed from the map and surrounding stations are made critical, the score goes up. 
### Max scores per configuration:

Hillclimber, 500 runs, 1.600 iterations - national map with Utrecht disabled - 7.842
