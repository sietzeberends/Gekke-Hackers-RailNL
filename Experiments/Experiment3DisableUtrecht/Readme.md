## Experiment 3 - disable Utrecht:
Utrecht is a very important station in The Netherlands and has a lot of critical connections around it. To measure the importance of this station we ran the maps of Holland with both Utrecht and without Utrecht to see the difference.

### Results:
The results are still being processed at the moment and will be available in the final version of this project.
