## Experiment 4 - make all stations critical:
Making all connections critical should have quite an impact on the score, given the score function that we are using (not the original one). This can be done on both the national map and the holland map.

### Results:
The scores when all connections are critical drop when compared with the plots of Experiment 2.

Best score on Holland map when all connections are critical:
